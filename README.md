# Background

Mr Chun = Chun Ge (simplified Chinese: 春哥; Tongyong Pinyin: Chūn Gē), which means "Brother Chun" and is often translated as "Spring Brother", is a nickname for the singer Li Yuchun, which subsequently became a popular Chinese Internet meme. She was known by this nickname in her youth due to her androgynous appearance and personal traits
